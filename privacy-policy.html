    <h1>Elias Bot Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 28 July 2025</p>

    <p>This Privacy Policy explains how Aidan McConnon ("I", "Me", "My") collects, uses, and protects information when you use my personal WhatsApp bot, which is powered by n8n and integrated with the Meta (WhatsApp) API (the "Bot").</p>

    <p><strong>Important Note:</strong> This Bot is intended for <strong>personal use only</strong> by Aidan McConnon and is not designed or intended for public, commercial, or third-party use.</p>

                <li><strong>Workflow Execution Data:</strong> Logs and temporary data generated by n8n as it processes your requests.</li>

I am responsible for the security of this instance. I implement reasonable security measures such as [mention any specific measures, e.g., "access controls, firewalls, and regular updates"] to protect the data.</li>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Meta (WhatsApp):</strong> For sending and receiving messages. Your interaction is directly with WhatsApp's platform. (See Meta's Privacy Policy: <a href="https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/privacy-policy" target="_blank">https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/privacy-policy</a>)</li>

    <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>I retain your data only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy, or as required by law or Meta's policies. For n8n workflows, I typically configure logs and execution data to be pruned regularly to minimize retention.</p>
